    <h1>Dieketseng Motsetse | WDD 130</h1>
    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Dieketseng Motsetse">
    <p>Hello! My name is Dieketseng Judith Motsetse, and I hail from the beautiful town of Vanderbijlpark in South Africa. As a single mother, I am dedicated to raising my 14-year-old son, who brings immense joy and purpose to my life. Being the youngest in my family, I have always looked up to my big sister and big brother, and we share a strong bond built on love and support.

      I find immense pleasure in spending quality time with my family, whether it's enjoying a hearty meal together, engaging in lively conversations, or simply being in each other's company. My passion for learning knows no bounds; I am constantly seeking new knowledge and skills. Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, as it allows me to explore different worlds and perspectives. Cooking is another passion of mine; I love experimenting with new recipes and creating delicious meals for my loved ones.
      
      Graphic designing and coding are not just hobbies for meâ€”they are integral parts of my journey towards becoming an accomplished professional. As an aspiring software developer, I am deeply fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers.
      
      In addition to my professional pursuits, I enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Bowling is a fun and exciting way for me to unwind, and I never miss an opportunity to watch a good movie. Gaming is another passion of mine; it not only provides entertainment but also challenges me to think strategically and creatively.
      
      Life is a constant adventure, and I embrace every moment with enthusiasm and a positive outlook. I am excited about the future and look forward to achieving my dreams and making a meaningful impact in the world.</p>
